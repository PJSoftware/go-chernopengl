# OpenGL with The Cherno

On YouTube, [The Cherno](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQ-W1KE9EYfdxhL6S4twUNw) has an [OpenGL playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3gAzLwfIP0&list=PLlrATfBNZ98foTJPJ_Ev03o2oq3-GGOS2). This playlist seems to provide a guide to learning OpenGL, using `C++`.

This is my attempt to follow along, while translating on the fly: I want to use `Go` instead.
