Maths.

- Matrices

## Matrices

A Matrix is essentially an array of numbers that we can manipulate in certain ways to get the results we need.

Useful for positioning objects in a 3D world.

## Vectors

There are two types of vectors we deal with in graphics programming:

- Directional vectors
- Positional vectors

## Matrices & Vectors

The most common usages of Matrices & Vectors os for transformations.

> I'm really glad you're covering maths for computer graphics. Please do more. If anyone is interested in visualizing vector and matrix maths I recommend watching **3blue1brown**'s `essence of linear algebra` playlist. It's so good for understanding what the maths is actually doing.
