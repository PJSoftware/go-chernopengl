# Mathematics in OpenGL

Maths.

- Matrices
- Vectors

## Matrices

A Matrix is essentially an array of numbers that we can manipulate in certain ways to get the results we need.

Useful for positioning objects in a 3D world.

## Vectors

There are two types of vectors we deal with in graphics programming:

- Directional vectors
- Positional vectors

## Matrices & Vectors

The most common usages of Matrices & Vectors os for transformations.

### Our first requirement

One of the first things our program will need to do is map the square that we are trying to draw onto the rectangular window that we have. This can be done with transformations.

### Maths Library

`The Cherno` is using a maths library called `glm`. There is a go-specific library called `glm`, but I'm not sure if it provides the same functions. If it seems that it does we'll give it a try -- but I'm tempted to write my own.

## From the Comments

> I'm really glad you're covering maths for computer graphics. Please do more. If anyone is interested in visualizing vector and matrix maths I recommend watching **3blue1brown**'s `essence of linear algebra` playlist. It's so good for understanding what the maths is actually doing.
