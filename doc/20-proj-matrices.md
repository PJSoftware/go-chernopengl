# Projection Matrices

"Projection" is how we convert our 3D triangles (be it a square or an entire 3D world) and map it -- project it -- onto our 2D window.

Convert into "normalised device coordinates" -- a "normalised space" that we can then map to our window. A normalised space is one that is fully represented between -1 and 1 (in both x and y coordinates.)
